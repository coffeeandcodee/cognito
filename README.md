Speculations of improved syntax for ML apps

MOTIVATION: More accessible yet effective use of ML
(neural networks use tensors)

- Simpler model architecture description syntax
A simplified model architecture syntax would make defining neural networks more succinct and intuitive 

- Optimized tensor operations and automatic differentiation as built in  features. This is lacking in Python and Julia. This helps reduce eliminate the dependency on libraries, which require significant performance overhead.

- Built in progress tracking and visualization, for monitoring model's training process (loss and accuracy). Having this as a native feature would make it simpler to track process
